Now we will explore list and its methods

INTRODUCTION TO LISTS
A list in Python is an ordered collection of items. Lists can contain a mix of different data types, including numbers, strings, and other lists. Lists are created by placing the items inside square brackets [], separated by commas.


Python lists come with a set of built-in methods:

append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
copy(): Returns a copy of the list.
count(): Returns the number of elements with the specified value.
extend(): Adds elements from another list (or any iterable) to the current list.
index(): Returns the index of the first element with the specified value.
insert(): Adds an element at a specified position.
pop(): Removes the element at a specified position.
remove(): Removes the first item with the specified value.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the list.
sort(): Sorts the list
